# Predictive-Airfare-Analysis

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is stored in the Excel file "Data_Train.xlsx".

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for flight prices based on various features such as airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure time, arrival time, duration, and total stops.

Data Preprocessing:
The dataset was loaded from an Excel file named "Data_Train.xlsx".
Data preprocessing steps included importing necessary libraries for preprocessing tasks, scaling features using MinMaxScaler, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Modeling:
Various machine learning models were imported, including Lasso regression, decision tree regressor, decision tree classifier, and random forest regressor.
The project likely involves regression tasks given the use of models like Lasso regression and decision tree regressor.
Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics used are not explicitly mentioned in the notebook.

Conclusion:
The project lays the foundation for building predictive models to estimate flight prices based on various features. Further work could involve more extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to improve the predictive performance of the models.
